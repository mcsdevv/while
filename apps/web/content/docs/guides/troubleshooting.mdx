- Database was duplicated without clearing sync data

**Solution:**

**Causes:**
- Notion date property doesn't include time

4. Verify timezone settings in both Google Calendar and Notion

## Connection Issues

### Redis Connection Failed

**Symptoms:**

- "Could not connect to Redis" error

**Solution:**

1. Check Upstash dashboard for database status
2. Verify environment variables:
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` starts with `https://`
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` is correct
3. Redeploy the app if variables were changed

### Webhook Registration Failed

**Symptoms:**
- Google Calendar changes not detected
- "Webhook setup failed" error

**Causes:**
- Domain not verified with Google
- Firewall blocking webhook calls

3. Try triggering webhook renewal from Settings

## Database Issues

### "Database not found" Error

**Symptoms:**
- Setup wizard can't find database
- Sync fails with database error

**Solution:**

1. Verify database ID is correct

- Required properties not available

**Solution:**

   - Title property (required)
   - Date property with time (required)
3. Refresh Settings page

## Performance Issues

### Slow Sync

**Symptoms:**
- Events take a long time to appear
- Dashboard shows sync queue backlog

**Causes:**
- Large number of events
- Rate limiting from APIs

**Solution:**

1. Check dashboard for rate limit warnings
2. Reduce number of events if possible
3. Events sync in batches - give it time to catch up

### High Error Rate

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard shows many failed syncs
- Specific events repeatedly fail

**Solution:**

1. Check logs for specific error messages
2. Identify problematic events (unusual characters, very long text)
3. Fix or delete problematic events
4. Reset sync if needed

## Reset and Recovery

### Reset Sync State

If sync gets into a bad state:

<Callout type="warn">
This will clear all sync data. Events won't be deleted but links between systems will be lost.
</Callout>

1. Go to Settings > Danger Zone
2. Click "Reset Sync"
3. Confirm the action
4. Re-run setup wizard

### Clear All Data

For a complete fresh start:

1. Go to Settings > Danger Zone
2. Click "Clear All Data"
3. This removes:
   - Stored credentials
   - Field mappings
   - Sync state
4. You'll need to complete setup again
