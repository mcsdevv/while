# Field Mapping Guide

Field mapping determines how your Notion database properties correspond to Google Calendar event fields.

## Overview

The sync supports mapping between these fields:

| Google Calendar | Notion Property Type | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Title | Title | Required |
| Start/End Time | Date | Required, must include time |
| Description | Text, Rich Text | Optional |
| Location | Text | Optional |
| Reminders | Number | Minutes before event |

## Required Mappings

### Title Property

Every event needs a title. Map this to your Notion Title property.

```
Google Calendar: Summary (Title)
↔
Notion: Your title property (e.g., "Event Name", "Name", "Title")
```

### Date Property

Events need a start time. Your Notion Date property must:
- Include time (not just date)
- Optionally include an end date/time

```
Google Calendar: Start/End DateTime
↔
Notion: Date property with time enabled
```

<Callout type="warn">
If your Notion Date property doesn't include time, the sync cannot determine when events occur during the day.
</Callout>

## Optional Mappings

### Description

Sync event details between description fields.

```
Google Calendar: Description
↔
Notion: Text or Rich Text property
```

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
Rich text formatting from Notion is converted to plain text in Google Calendar.
</Callout>

### Location

Sync physical or virtual locations.

```
Google Calendar: Location
↔
Notion: Text property
```

### Reminders

Set how many minutes before an event to trigger a reminder.

```
Google Calendar: Reminder (popup notification)
↔
Notion: Number property (minutes)
```

Example values:
- `15` = 15 minutes before
- `60` = 1 hour before
- `1440` = 1 day before (60 × 24)

## Configuring Mappings

### During Setup

The setup wizard automatically suggests mappings based on property names:

1. Properties named "Title", "Name", or "Event" → Title
2. Properties named "Date", "When", or "Time" → Date
3. Properties named "Description", "Notes", or "Details" → Description
4. Properties named "Location", "Where", or "Place" → Location

### In Settings

After setup, you can modify mappings in the Settings page:

1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Click **Settings**
3. Find the **Field Mapping** section
4. Select Notion properties for each Google Calendar field
5. Click **Save**

## GCal Event ID Property

The sync automatically creates and manages a special property:

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `gcal_event_id` | Text | Links events between Notion and Google Calendar |

<Callout type="warn">
Do not modify or delete this property. It's how the sync knows which Notion pages correspond to which Google Calendar events.
</Callout>

### Hiding the Property

To keep your database clean:

1. Open your Notion database
2. Click the property header dropdown
3. Select **Hide in view**

The property remains functional but won't clutter your views.

## Sync Behavior

### New Events

When you create an event in either system:

1. Event is created in the other system
2. Field mappings determine what data transfers
3. `gcal_event_id` links them together

### Updates

When you modify an event:

1. Change is detected (webhook for Google, polling for Notion)
2. Corresponding event in other system is updated
3. Only mapped fields are synced

### Deletions

When you delete an event:

1. Corresponding event in other system is also deleted
2. The link is removed

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Property not appearing in dropdown">
    - Ensure the property exists in your database
    - Check that the property type is compatible
    - Refresh the settings page
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data not syncing for a field">
    - Verify the mapping is configured
    - Check the property types are compatible
    - Look for errors in the dashboard logs
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Times are wrong">
    - Ensure your Notion date property includes time
    - Check timezone settings in both systems
    - Verify the date format in Notion
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Best Practices

<Cards>
  <Card title="Use Clear Names">
    Name your Notion properties clearly (e.g., "Event Date" not "Date1")
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enable Time">
    Always enable time on your Date property for accurate scheduling
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hide System Fields">
    Hide the `gcal_event_id` property to keep views clean
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Changes">
    After changing mappings, create a test event to verify sync works
  </Card>
</Cards>
