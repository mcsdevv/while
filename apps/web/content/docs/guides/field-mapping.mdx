Field mapping determines how your Notion database properties correspond to Google Calendar event fields.

## Overview

The sync supports mapping between these fields:

### Core Fields

| Google Calendar | Notion Property Type | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Title | Title | Required |
| Start/End Time | Date | Required, must include time |
| Description | Text, Rich Text | Optional |
| Location | Text | Optional |
| Reminders | Number | Minutes before event |

### Extended Fields

| Google Calendar | Notion Property Type | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| Attendees | Rich Text | One-way sync (GCal → Notion) |
| Organizer | Rich Text | One-way sync (GCal → Notion) |
| Conference Link | Rich Text | Video meeting URL |
| Recurrence | Rich Text | Human-readable pattern |
| Color | Rich Text | Event color name |
| Visibility | Rich Text | public/private/default |

<Callout type="info">
Extended fields sync one-way from Google Calendar to Notion. Editing these fields in Notion won't update the Google Calendar event.
</Callout>

## Required Mappings

### Title Property

Every event needs a title. Map this to your Notion Title property.

```
Google Calendar: Summary (Title)
↔
Notion: Your title property (e.g., "Event Name", "Name", "Title")
```

### Date Property

Events need a start time. Your Notion Date property must:
- Include time (not just date)
- Optionally include an end date/time

```
Google Calendar: Start/End DateTime
↔
Notion: Date property with time enabled
```

<Callout type="warn">
If your Notion Date property doesn't include time, the sync cannot determine when events occur during the day.
</Callout>

## Optional Mappings

### Description

Sync event details between description fields.

```
Google Calendar: Description
↔
Notion: Text or Rich Text property
```

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
Rich text formatting from Notion is converted to plain text in Google Calendar.
</Callout>

### Location

Sync physical or virtual locations.

```
Google Calendar: Location
↔
Notion: Text property
```

### Reminders

Set how many minutes before an event to trigger a reminder.

```
Google Calendar: Reminder (popup notification)
↔
Notion: Number property (minutes)
```

Example values:
- `15` = 15 minutes before
- `60` = 1 hour before
- `1440` = 1 day before (60 × 24)

## Extended Fields

Extended fields bring additional event metadata from Google Calendar into Notion. These fields are disabled by default and sync one-way (GCal → Notion only).

<Callout type="warn">
Extended fields are read-only in Notion. Changes made in Notion won't sync back to Google Calendar.
</Callout>

### Attendees

Shows who's invited to the event.

```
Google Calendar: Event attendees
→
Notion: Rich Text property (comma-separated list)
```

Example value: `alice@example.com, bob@example.com`

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
Your own email is excluded from the attendees list to reduce clutter.
</Callout>

### Organizer

Shows who created or owns the event.

```
Google Calendar: Event organizer
→
Notion: Rich Text property
```

Example value: `Alice Smith` or `alice@example.com`

### Conference Link

Captures video meeting URLs from the event.

```
Google Calendar: Conference data (Meet, Zoom, etc.)
→
Notion: Rich Text property (URL)
```

Example value: `https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij`

### Recurrence

Shows the repeat pattern for recurring events.

```
Google Calendar: RRULE (recurrence rule)
→
Notion: Rich Text property (human-readable)
```

Example values:
- `Weekly on Monday`
- `Daily`
- `Monthly on the 15th`
- `Every 2 weeks on Tuesday, Thursday`

### Color

Captures the event's color label from Google Calendar.

```
Google Calendar: Color ID
→
Notion: Rich Text property (color name)
```

Color names: `Tomato`, `Flamingo`, `Tangerine`, `Banana`, `Sage`, `Basil`, `Peacock`, `Blueberry`, `Lavender`, `Grape`, `Graphite`

### Visibility

Shows who can see the event.

```
Google Calendar: Event visibility
→
Notion: Rich Text property
```

Values:
- `default` - Uses calendar's default visibility
- `public` - Visible to anyone
- `private` - Only visible to attendees

## Enabling Fields

Extended fields are disabled by default. To enable them:

### During Setup

The setup wizard shows toggle switches for each extended field. Enable the fields you want to sync.

### In Settings

1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Click **Settings**
3. Find the **Field Mapping** section
4. Toggle on the extended fields you want
5. Optionally set custom Notion property names
6. Click **Save**

<Callout type="info">
When you enable a new field, only future events will have that field populated. Use backfill to update existing events.
</Callout>

## Backfilling Existing Events

When you enable a new extended field, existing Notion pages won't have that data yet. Use backfill to populate them.

### Starting a Backfill

1. Go to **Settings** in your dashboard
2. Find the **Backfill** section
3. Select the fields you want to backfill
4. Click **Start Backfill**

### Progress Tracking

The dashboard shows:
- Total events to process
- Events completed
- Current status (running/completed/failed)

<Callout type="warn">
Backfill can take several minutes for large calendars. Don't close the dashboard while it's running.
</Callout>

## Configuring Mappings

### During Setup

The setup wizard automatically suggests mappings based on property names:

1. Properties named "Title", "Name", or "Event" → Title
2. Properties named "Date", "When", or "Time" → Date
3. Properties named "Description", "Notes", or "Details" → Description
4. Properties named "Location", "Where", or "Place" → Location

### In Settings

After setup, you can modify mappings in the Settings page:

1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Click **Settings**
3. Find the **Field Mapping** section
4. Select Notion properties for each Google Calendar field
5. Click **Save**

## GCal Event ID Property

The sync automatically creates and manages a special property:

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `gcal_event_id` | Text | Links events between Notion and Google Calendar |

<Callout type="warn">
Do not modify or delete this property. It's how the sync knows which Notion pages correspond to which Google Calendar events.
</Callout>

### Hiding the Property

To keep your database clean:

1. Open your Notion database
2. Click the property header dropdown
3. Select **Hide in view**

The property remains functional but won't clutter your views.

## Sync Behavior

### New Events

When you create an event in either system:

1. Event is created in the other system
2. Field mappings determine what data transfers
3. `gcal_event_id` links them together

### Updates

When you modify an event:

1. Change is detected (webhooks for both Google and Notion)
2. Corresponding event in other system is updated
3. Only mapped fields are synced

### Deletions

When you delete an event:

1. Corresponding event in other system is also deleted
2. The link is removed

## Troubleshooting

<FAQAccordion>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="Property not appearing in dropdown">
    - Ensure the property exists in your database
    - Check that the property type is compatible
    - Refresh the settings page
  </FAQAccordionItem>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="Data not syncing for a field">
    - Verify the mapping is configured
    - Check the property types are compatible
    - Look for errors in the dashboard logs
  </FAQAccordionItem>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="Times are wrong">
    - Ensure your Notion date property includes time
    - Check timezone settings in both systems
    - Verify the date format in Notion
  </FAQAccordionItem>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="Extended field changes in Notion not syncing">
    Extended fields (attendees, organizer, conference link, recurrence, color, visibility) only sync one-way from Google Calendar to Notion. To change these values, edit the event in Google Calendar.
  </FAQAccordionItem>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="Extended fields empty for existing events">
    When you enable a new field, only future events get the data. Use the Backfill feature in Settings to populate existing events.
  </FAQAccordionItem>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="Recurrence showing raw RRULE format">
    If you see text like `RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO` instead of human-readable text, report this as a bug. The sync should convert these automatically.
  </FAQAccordionItem>
</FAQAccordion>

## Best Practices

<Cards>
  <Card title="Use Clear Names">
    Name your Notion properties clearly (e.g., "Event Date" not "Date1")
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enable Time">
    Always enable time on your Date property for accurate scheduling
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hide System Fields">
    Hide the `gcal_event_id` property to keep views clean
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Changes">
    After changing mappings, create a test event to verify sync works
  </Card>
</Cards>
