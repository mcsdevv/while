## General

<FAQAccordion>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="How does the sync work?">
    The sync uses webhooks for both directions. When you modify events in Google Calendar, webhooks capture changes instantly and sync them to Notion. Similarly, when you modify pages in Notion, webhooks capture those changes and sync them to Google Calendar. A daily fallback sync runs to catch any missed webhooks in rare edge cases. Both directions use intelligent conflict resolution where the most recent change wins.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="Is my data secure?">
    Yes, absolutely. This is a self-hosted solution where you deploy to your own Vercel account. Your credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and data is stored in Redis via Vercel Marketplace. No data ever passes through third-party servers, giving you complete control over your data.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="How much does it cost?">
    It's completely free for personal use. Vercel's free tier is sufficient and includes Redis via Marketplace. Both the Google Calendar API and Notion API are free for personal use. You might need paid tiers if you have high-volume usage.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="Is this project affiliated with Notion or Google?">
    No, this is an independent open-source project. It's not officially supported by or affiliated with Notion or Google.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="Will there be a hosted version?">
    Highly unlikely unless there is significant demand. The intention here is to make available something of personal use that may have wider application, nothing more.
  </FAQAccordionItem>
</FAQAccordion>

## Setup

<FAQAccordion>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="Why do my Google tokens expire after 7 days?">
    This happens when your Google OAuth app is in "Testing" mode. Google limits test apps to 7-day token expiration.

    **To fix:**
    1. Go to Google Cloud Console
    2. Navigate to OAuth consent screen
    3. Click "Publish App"

    Published apps have longer-lived refresh tokens.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="Can I sync multiple calendars?">
    Each deployment syncs one Google Calendar with one Notion database. For multiple calendars, deploy a separate instance for each calendar with different Notion databases. Each instance runs independently, which keeps things simple and avoids conflicts.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="What Notion properties are required?">
    At minimum, you need:

    | Property | Type | Notes |
    |----------|------|-------|
    | Title | Title | For event names |
    | Date | Date | Must include time |

    Optional but recommended:
    - Description (Text)
    - Location (Text)
    - Reminders (Number)

    The sync will also create a `gcal_event_id` property automatically.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="Do I need to verify my domain with Google?">
    For basic usage, no. The webhook endpoint on Vercel works without additional domain verification.

    If you're using a custom domain and encounter issues, you may need to verify it in Google Search Console.
  </FAQAccordionItem>
</FAQAccordion>

## Sync Behavior

<FAQAccordion>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="How quickly do changes sync?">
    Changes sync nearly instantly in both directions via webhooks. A daily fallback sync also runs to catch any edge cases where webhooks might be missed.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="What happens if I delete an event?">
    When you delete an event in either system, the sync detects the deletion and removes the corresponding event in the other system along with the link between them. This is bidirectional—deleting in Notion deletes in Google Calendar and vice versa.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="How are conflicts handled?">
    When the same event is modified in both systems simultaneously, the sync compares modification timestamps and the most recent change wins. Both systems are then updated to match. To avoid conflicts, try to edit events in only one system at a time.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="Does it sync recurring events?">
    Recurring events have limited support. Individual instances sync normally, but modifying the recurrence pattern may cause unexpected behavior and creating recurring events from Notion is not fully supported. For best results, create recurring events in Google Calendar.
  </FAQAccordionItem>
</FAQAccordion>

## Troubleshooting

<FAQAccordion>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="Events aren't syncing, what's wrong?">
    Check these common issues:

    1. **Dashboard errors**: Look for error messages in the logs
    2. **Token expiration**: Re-authenticate if tokens expired
    3. **Field mapping**: Ensure all required fields are mapped
    4. **Database connection**: Verify integration is connected to database

    See the [Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/guides/troubleshooting) for detailed steps.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="Why are event times wrong?">
    This is usually caused by the Notion date property not having "Include time" enabled, a timezone mismatch between systems, or all-day events being handled differently than timed events. Ensure your Notion Date property includes time, not just date.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="Can I reset and start fresh?">
    Yes. Go to Settings > Danger Zone where you can either Reset Sync (clears sync state but keeps credentials) or Clear All Data (removes everything, requires re-setup). Note that this doesn't delete events, just the links between systems.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

## Technical

<FAQAccordion>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="What tech stack is this built with?">
    - **Framework**: Next.js 16 with App Router
    - **Runtime**: Vercel serverless functions
    - **Storage**: Redis (via Vercel Marketplace)
    - **UI**: React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
    - **Auth**: NextAuth.js

    It's a monorepo using Turborepo for builds.
  </FAQAccordionItem>

  <FAQAccordionItem title="Can I run this locally?">
    Yes! For development:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mcsdevv/while
    cd while
    pnpm install
    cp apps/dashboard/.env.example apps/dashboard/.env.local
    # Configure environment variables
    pnpm dev
    ```

    Note: Webhooks won't work locally unless you use a tunneling service like ngrok.
