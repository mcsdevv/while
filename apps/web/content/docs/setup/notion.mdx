This guide walks through creating a Notion integration and connecting it to your calendar database.

## Step 1: Create Integration

<Steps>
<Step>

### Open Integrations

Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)

</Step>
<Step>

### Create New

Click **New integration**

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure

- **Name**: `Calendar Sync`
- **Associated workspace**: Select your workspace
- **Logo**: Optional

</Step>
<Step>

### Submit

Click **Submit** to create the integration

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure Capabilities

After creating the integration, configure its capabilities:

### Content Capabilities
| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Read content | **Enabled** (required) |
| Update content | **Enabled** (required) |
| Insert content | **Enabled** (required) |

### Comment & User Capabilities
| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Read comments | Disabled (not needed) |
| Insert comments | Disabled (not needed) |
| Read user information | Disabled (not needed) |

Click **Save changes**.

## Step 3: Copy Integration Token

1. On the integration page, find **Internal Integration Secret**
2. Click **Show** then **Copy**
3. Save this token securely

<Callout type="warn">
This token starts with `secret_` and is shown only once. If lost, you'll need to regenerate it.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Connect to Database

The integration needs explicit access to your calendar database.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Open Database

Open your Notion calendar database as a full page

</Step>
<Step>

### Open Menu

Click the **...** menu in the top right

</Step>
<Step>

### Add Connection

Go to **Connections** (or **Add connections**)

</Step>
<Step>

### Select Integration

Find and select your **Calendar Sync** integration

</Step>
<Step>

### Confirm

Click **Confirm** to grant access

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Get Database ID

You'll need your database ID for configuration.

### From the URL

1. Open your database in Notion (as a full page, not inline)
2. Look at the URL:

```
https://notion.so/workspace/DATABASE_ID?v=VIEW_ID
```

3. The DATABASE_ID is the 32-character string before the `?`

### Example

URL: `https://notion.so/myworkspace/a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234ab?v=...`

Database ID: `a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234ab`

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
The setup wizard accepts the database ID with or without dashes.
</Callout>

## Database Schema

Your database should have properties for calendar events. The setup wizard will help map your existing properties.

### Recommended Properties

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Name/Title | Title | Event title (required) |
| Date | Date | Event date/time with end date (required) |
| Description | Text | Event details |
| Location | Text | Event location |
| Reminders | Number | Minutes before event for reminder |

### Required Property for Sync

The sync creates one additional property automatically:

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| GCal Event ID | Text | Links events between systems |

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
You can create this manually or let the setup wizard create it. Hide it in your views for a cleaner look.
</Callout>

## Environment Variables

After completing this setup, you'll have the **Internal Integration Secret**:

| Variable | Description | Your Value |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `NOTION_API_TOKEN` | Your integration secret (starts with `secret_`) | |

<Callout type="info">
Notion uses an internal integration (API token), not OAuth. You'll enter this token during the setup wizard.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

<FAQAccordion>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="Could not find database">
    - Ensure the integration is connected to the database
    - Check the database ID is correct
    - Verify the integration has read/write permissions
  </FAQAccordionItem>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="Unauthorized Error">
    - Token may have been regenerated
    - Check the token starts with `secret_`
    - Ensure you're using the correct workspace
  </FAQAccordionItem>
  <FAQAccordionItem title="Missing Properties">
    - The setup wizard shows available properties
    - Create missing properties in Notion if needed
    - Date property must support time (not just date)
  </FAQAccordionItem>
</FAQAccordion>

## Security Notes

<Callout type="warn">
- Integration tokens have full access to connected pages
- Only connect the integration to databases it needs
- Don't share your integration token publicly
- Regenerate the token if compromised
</Callout>
