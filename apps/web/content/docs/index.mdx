## Why This Project?

Managing events across both Notion and Google Calendar often means:
- Double-entering events manually
- Forgetting to update one system when changes happen
- Losing track of what's accurate

This sync eliminates all of that by keeping both systems perfectly in sync.

## Key Features

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Bidirectional Sync">
    Changes made in either Notion or Google Calendar are automatically synced to the other.
    Edit in whichever app you prefer - both stay current.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Real-time Updates">
    Google Calendar changes are captured via webhooks for instant updates.
    Notion changes are detected through polling every 2 minutes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Self-Hosted & Private">
    Deploy to your own Vercel account. Your credentials are encrypted and stored in your own Redis instance.
    No data passes through third-party servers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom Field Mapping">
    Map any Notion property to Google Calendar fields.
    Full control over how your data syncs between systems.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## How It Works

```

1. **Google → Notion**: Webhooks capture changes instantly
2. **Notion → Google**: Polling detects changes every 2 minutes
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Most recent change wins

## Requirements

- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account (free tier works)
- A Google account with Google Calendar
- A Notion account with a calendar database
