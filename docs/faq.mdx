# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does the sync work?">
    The sync uses two mechanisms:

    - **Google → Notion**: Webhooks capture changes instantly when you modify events in Google Calendar
    - **Notion → Google**: Polling checks for changes every 2 minutes

    Both directions use intelligent conflict resolution where the most recent change wins.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data secure?">
    Yes, absolutely. This is a self-hosted solution:

    - You deploy to your own Vercel account
    - Credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM
    - Data is stored in your own Upstash Redis instance
    - No data ever passes through third-party servers

    You have complete control over your data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does it cost?">
    It's completely free for personal use:

    - **Vercel**: Free tier is sufficient
    - **Upstash Redis**: Free tier provides 10K commands/day
    - **Google Calendar API**: Free for personal use
    - **Notion API**: Free

    You might need paid tiers if you have high-volume usage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this project affiliated with Notion or Google?">
    No, this is an independent open-source project. It's not officially supported by or affiliated with Notion or Google.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do my Google tokens expire after 7 days?">
    This happens when your Google OAuth app is in "Testing" mode. Google limits test apps to 7-day token expiration.

    **To fix:**
    1. Go to Google Cloud Console
    2. Navigate to OAuth consent screen
    3. Click "Publish App"

    Published apps have longer-lived refresh tokens.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I sync multiple calendars?">
    Each deployment syncs one Google Calendar with one Notion database. For multiple calendars:

    1. Deploy a separate instance for each calendar
    2. Use different Notion databases for each
    3. Each instance runs independently

    This keeps things simple and avoids conflicts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What Notion properties are required?">
    At minimum, you need:

    | Property | Type | Notes |
    |----------|------|-------|
    | Title | Title | For event names |
    | Date | Date | Must include time |

    Optional but recommended:
    - Description (Text)
    - Location (Text)
    - Reminders (Number)

    The sync will also create a `gcal_event_id` property automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to verify my domain with Google?">
    For basic usage, no. The webhook endpoint on Vercel works without additional domain verification.

    If you're using a custom domain and encounter issues, you may need to verify it in Google Search Console.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Sync Behavior

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How quickly do changes sync?">
    - **Google → Notion**: Nearly instant (via webhooks)
    - **Notion → Google**: Up to 2 minutes (polling interval)

    The 2-minute delay for Notion changes is due to API limitations - Notion doesn't support webhooks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete an event?">
    When you delete an event in either system:
    1. The sync detects the deletion
    2. The corresponding event in the other system is also deleted
    3. The link between them is removed

    This is bidirectional - deleting in Notion deletes in Google Calendar and vice versa.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are conflicts handled?">
    When the same event is modified in both systems simultaneously:

    1. The sync compares modification timestamps
    2. The most recent change wins
    3. Both systems are updated to match

    To avoid conflicts, try to edit events in only one system at a time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does it sync recurring events?">
    Recurring events have limited support:

    - Individual instances sync normally
    - Modifying the recurrence pattern may cause unexpected behavior
    - Creating recurring events from Notion is not fully supported

    For best results, create recurring events in Google Calendar.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Events aren't syncing, what's wrong?">
    Check these common issues:

    1. **Dashboard errors**: Look for error messages in the logs
    2. **Token expiration**: Re-authenticate if tokens expired
    3. **Field mapping**: Ensure all required fields are mapped
    4. **Database connection**: Verify integration is connected to database

    See the [Troubleshooting Guide](/guides/troubleshooting) for detailed steps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are event times wrong?">
    Usually caused by:

    1. **Notion date property**: Must have "Include time" enabled
    2. **Timezone mismatch**: Check settings in both systems
    3. **All-day events**: Handled differently than timed events

    Ensure your Notion Date property includes time, not just date.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I reset and start fresh?">
    Yes. Go to Settings > Danger Zone:

    - **Reset Sync**: Clears sync state but keeps credentials
    - **Clear All Data**: Removes everything, requires re-setup

    Note: This doesn't delete events, just the links between systems.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What tech stack is this built with?">
    - **Framework**: Next.js 16 with App Router
    - **Runtime**: Vercel serverless functions
    - **Storage**: Upstash Redis
    - **UI**: React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
    - **Auth**: NextAuth.js

    It's a monorepo using Turborepo for builds.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I run this locally?">
    Yes! For development:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mcsdevv/notion-gcal-sync
    cd notion-gcal-sync
    pnpm install
    cp apps/dashboard/.env.example apps/dashboard/.env.local
    # Configure environment variables
    pnpm dev
    ```

    Note: Webhooks won't work locally unless you use a tunneling service like ngrok.
