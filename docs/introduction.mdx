## Why This Project?

Managing events across both Notion and Google Calendar often means:
- Double-entering events manually
- Forgetting to update one system when changes happen
- Losing track of what's accurate

This sync eliminates all of that by keeping both systems perfectly in sync.

## Key Features

## How It Works

```

1. **Google → Notion**: Webhooks capture changes instantly
2. **Notion → Google**: Polling detects changes every 2 minutes
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Most recent change wins
